Expectations are for 203,000 new jobs to be created, according to economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires, compared to 227,000 jobs added in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.3%. \\n \\n Here at MarketBeat HQ, we’ll be offering color commentary before and after the data crosses the wires.

And while you’re here, why don’t you sign up to follow us on Twitter. \\n \\n Enjoy the show. ||||| Employers pulled back sharply on hiring last month, a reminder that the U.S. economy may not be growing fast enough to sustain robust job growth. The unemployment rate dipped, but mostly because more Americans stopped looking for work. \\n \\n The Labor Department says the economy added 120,000 jobs in March, down from more than 200,000 in each of the previous three months. \\n \\n The unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The rate dropped because fewer people searched for jobs. The official unemployment tally only includes those seeking work. \\n \\n The economy has added 858,000 jobs since December _ the best four months of hiring in two years.

Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, businessman Herman Cain, former Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and, surprisingly, Michigan Rep. Thaddeus McCotter each paid a minimum of $15,000 to rent space outside the arena where the August 13 straw poll will take place. \\n \\n \\n \\n Newt Gingrich\\u2019s reportedly cash-strapped campaign, which had long-planned to run a robust Iowa effort, did not bid on a spot. Gingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis confirmed the decision, but said the candidate is \\u201ccommitted to the caucuses\\u201d and plans to return to the state several times in the coming weeks. \\n \\n McCotter, a guitar-playing conservative with a quirky reputation on Capitol Hill, has not made an official decision about running for president. But his investment in Ames is the most serious sign to date that he plans to join the ever-widening Republican field. \\n \\n Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman are each keeping their sights on New Hampshire rather than Iowa and have already announced plans to skip the straw poll. \\n \\n The contest, a fundraiser for the Iowa Republican Party that is traditionally seen as a test of each campaign\\u2019s organizational strength in the state, is hardly predictive. \\n \\n In 2007, Romney spent heavily to win the straw poll only to come up short in the caucuses to the Republican who finished second in the straw poll, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. \\n \\n Expectations are key: A strong showing can do wonders for lesser-known candidates, as it did for Huckabee in 2008. Conversely, an underwhelming performance can unravel a campaign hoping to do well in the caucuses. \\n \\n Iowa GOP officials ran a bidding process Thursday to auction off lots closest to arena, where each campaign will set up tents and stages to rally their supporters with food, music and swag before the vote. \\n \\n Positions closer to the Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State University, where the straw poll balloting occurs, are most expensive. \\n \\n Sources told CNN that Paul\\u2019s campaign outbid the competition and landed the premier location at the event site.

Mallards are widely adaptable, from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory, and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to man-made, including reservoirs, urban parks and irrigation canals ( Carboneras 1992 ). Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck, Mallard diet has been well described. They are regarded as omnivorous, feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land ( Snow and Perrins 1998 ). Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates ( Dessborn et al. 2011 ), but may occasionally include amphibians or fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). The digestible protein content of the food, especially animal protein from insect larvae, appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings ( Street 1978 ). High-protein food is also required by Mallards during egg-laying, whereas other energy-demanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits ( Pehrsson 1984 ). Experimental work on nutrient-poor lakes in Sweden suggested that food limitation and adverse weather are major factors for high duckling mortality and why some lakes have low abundance or even absence of dabbling ducks ( Gunnarson et al. 2004 ). However, even during periods when the requirement for animal protein is at its highest, Mallards focus on aquatic invertebrates, and information on vertebrate predation is generally rarely reported. We report the first documented cases of hunting and consumption of birds by wild Mallards. Methods The Trei Ape reservoir (45\\u00b0 12\\u2032 N, 22\\u00b0 08\\u2032 E), bordering the Semenic-Caras Gorges National Park (Natura 2000 ROSCI0226 site) in southwest Romania, was visited over 6 days in July 2016. The reservoir, created in 1970, is a large, 53-ha freshwater body at 850-m altitude, with a maximum depth around 30 m and a relatively complex structure following river valleys in three main directions. It has moderate usage for tourism activities including camping, rowing and angling, primarily for European chub ( Squalius cephalus), European perch ( Perca fluviatilis ), brown trout ( Salmo trutta fario ) and Zander ( Sander lucioperca ). The edges of the reservoir are largely covered by woodland, mostly deciduous, with beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) and alder ( Alnus glutinosa ), scrub, and conifers, mainly Norway spruce ( Picea abies ). Sheep ( Ovis aries ) summer pastures cover the higher slopes of the northern shore. Most of the reservoir is deep, open water with little or no aquatic vegetation. However, dense and tall riparian vegetation areas exist where the three main streams feed into the lake, and large populations of amphibians, primarily common frog ( Ranatemporaria ) and common toad ( Bufo bufo ), breed in these sections ( Petrovan et al. 2006 ). Small numbers of Mallards (30\\u201350 pairs), Grey Herons ( Ardea cinerea ) and Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ) are typically encountered on the water's edge during March\\u2013October, together with more occasional observations of species such as Black Stork ( Ciconia nigra ). During May-September, large numbers of summer migrants, especially Black Redstarts ( Phoenicuros ochruros ), Barn Swallows ( Hirundo rustica ), House Martins ( Delichon urbicum ), and Red-backed Shrikes ( Lanius collurio), as well as other resident passerine birds such as Black-birds ( Turdus merula ), breed and raise their young on the edges of the reservoir. The Mallards are not fed by people and generally maintain a large flight distance. Results A group of Mallards ( n = 11) was observed on 17 July 2016 in the eastern part of the lake, in overcast weather with a temperature of 18 \\u00b0C, starting at 17:30 hr. The group consisted of one adult female with 10 subadults of consistent size, ~2/3 of the adult size and with incompletely formed plumage. Using binoculars and telephoto lenses, we observed the Mallards for ~15 min during their foraging activities at the water's edge. They were vigorously shaking the riparian and scrub vegetation on the bank. Following this activity, the adult Mallard was observed repeatedly shaking its head laterally and compressing a passerine bird in its bill. The bird was identified from pictures and recording video as a Grey Wagtail fledgling with almost complete plumage ( Fig. 1 ). The adult Mallard was repeatedly mobbed by the vocalizing subadults trying to remove parts of the bird carcass, but the adult defended it. The adult Mallard had obvious difficulties with swallowing the whole bird, partly due to the extended wings of the Grey Wagtail. The female Mallard repeatedly submerged the carcass, repositioned it in its bill and tilted its head backward, a process lasting over 10 min until the Grey Wagtail was eventually entirely consumed. During this time, a second bird was flushed from the bankside vegetation by the activity of the subadults shaking the long undergrowth, and landed on the water surface, some 30 m from the bank and 12 m away from the Mallard group. The bird, identified from pictures as a fledgling Black Redstart ( Fig. 2 ), opened its wings and started thrashing on the water's surface giving out distress calls. The Black Redstart was chased by several subadult Mallards and was repeatedly attacked, grabbed and submerged as the ducks tried to swallow it or remove parts of it. Following continuous attacks by between two to five Mallards positioned in a circle, the Black Redstart disappeared, either drowned and submerged or consumed by one or more of the subadults. During the attack, which lasted less than 3 min, the subadult Mallards continued to vocalize in short, repeated calls while trying to take control of the prey. The entire group of Mallards, including the adult female, then emerged onto a floating tree trunk for basking and preening as the group entered a phase of rest. Figure 1. Figure 2. Discussion Remarkably for such a widespread and well-studied species, these are, to our knowledge, the first observations of avian hunting and predation by Mallards. The completely new behavior exhibited by this group is even more significant considering that vertebrate consumption has rarely been described in this species and almost only on fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). Even Pekin (domestic) ducks ( A. platyrhynchos domesticus ) do not exhibit a tendency for aggressive and predatory behavior in commercial farming compared to other species such as Muscovy Ducks ( Cairina moschata ) ( Riber and Mensh 2008 ). Also, comparing wild and domesticated Mallards in an experimental setting demonstrated that wild Mallards show significant avoidance and reticence toward novel food ( Desforges and Wood-Gush 1975 ), possibly as an indication of either dietary conservatism or neophobia. This fits the wider literature observations of avian predators often avoiding novel insect prey ( Coppinger 1969 ) or reduced predation rates by birds of prey of songbird species with conspicuous plumage ( G\\u00f6tmark 1994 ). However, Mallards have recently been shown to learn to exploit new food sources, such as entering the sea to predate Pacific sand crabs ( Emerita analoga ) in multiple locations in California ( Lafferty et al. 2013 ). The fact that one predation event was conducted solely by the subadults, with great speed and with no hesitation, suggests they were experienced enough in such bird attacks to overcome any dietary conservatism. Yet, it seems unlikely that Mallards would have much success at capturing birds outside of the bird breeding season when fledglings are abundant, both on land and at the water's edge. Innovation during foraging can result in the development of new behaviors or the modification of existing ones to take advantage of new opportunities in the environment, such as the exploitation of new food sources ( Overington et al. 2011 ). If Mallards were limited by the lack of animal protein, for instance due to intense competition for insect larvae by fish introduced for angling ( Hill et al. 1987 ), it is possible that the inclusion of a new, energy-rich food source would offer a significant advantage at a critical time of the year. However, behavior innovation can increase risks, and predation of birds by Mallards could increase transmission of pathogens such as parasites or Salmonella, which has been found to be associated with raptors that predate other bird species ( Tizard 2004 ).

Meanwhile, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman skipped for strategic reasons, notes CNN; they're focusing on New Hampshire.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Joshua Quick is being hailed as a hero\\u2014now, if only he would agree. \\\"I want to offer my gratitude to everybody,\\\" said the second-year Florida State University law student Friday at a meeting of FSU's board of trustees, per the Tallahassee Democrat. \\\"Thank you all for the recognition I don't feel I deserve.\\\" FSU President John Thrasher and the board promised at least $30,000 of their own money to pay Quick's school costs for his actions during the Nov. 2 hot-yoga shooting in Tallahassee. \\\"We are going to start an effort to take care of the rest of his time at our law school,\\\" said Thrasher, who expressed hope the board would give more. \\\"I want you to know how much gratitude we have for what you did.\\\" Quick has stayed humble about his actions that day. On Good Morning America, Quick said he only struck shooter Scott Beierle with his own gun because the weapon had stopped firing, per USA Today. The 40-year-old assailant pistol-whipped Quick until bloodied, but the student kept fighting: \\\"I jumped up as quickly as I could, ran back over and next thing you know, I'm grabbing a broom, anything I can,\\\" said Quick. \\\"And I hit him again.\\\" Quick's actions allowed others to escape the studio where two women\\u2014Dr. Nancy Van Nessem, 61, and student Maura Binkley, 21\\u2014were murdered in cold blood and five were wounded. \\\"I want to thank that guy from the bottom of my heart,\\\" says survivor Daniela Garcia Albalat, \\\"because he saved my life.\\\" (Beierle demeaned women in YouTube videos.)\",\n          \"\\u2013 You probably thought ducks were cute waddlers who liked to eat your stale bread. Poof, your bubble has been burst. The BBC reports wild mallard ducks have been spotted eating other birds, swallowing one nearly whole, an \\\"extraordinary\\\" behavior that has never been observed before. Zoologist Silviu Petrovan of the University of Cambridge was birdwatching at a reservoir in Romania when he spotted a flock of mallards hunting a fledgling that had landed on the water. A female duck grabbed the grey wagtail in her beak, dunked it several times beneath the water, then ate it, Petrovan says. A black redstart landed soon after and \\\"was almost instantaneously attacked\\\" by 10 juveniles, per the study in the journal Waterbirds. Though mallards in California have been sighted munching on sand crabs, the ducks usually eat plants, insects, and the occasional small fish. As far as scientists can tell, such predatory behavior not involving fish or amphibians has never been seen before. It's not only \\\"very rare\\\" but also likely a new phenomenon, says Petrovan, noting mallards have \\\"not ... really evolved\\\" to digest bones and feathers. \\\"The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail, presumably because it couldn't actually tear it to pieces\\\" due to the design of its bill. So why would a duck eat a bird at all? Petrovan suggests \\\"pressure for those fast-growing juveniles to get animal protein intake.\\\" (These birds are probably safe.)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The location of the candidates is considered critically important. \\n \\n Today\\u2019s bidding briefly took an emotional turn with several campaigns walked out in protest when a representative for U.S. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter, R-Mich., initially asked to bid without naming the congressman. \\n \\n Gingrich\\u2019s campaign sent an Iowa State student as its representative at the auction, Hammond said. The campaign may participate in the event but wasn\\u2019t interested in spending money for a premium spot, he said. \\n \\n After today, candidates can no longer purchase lots but may still participate in the straw poll, according to current rules. \\n \\n Gingrich\\u2019s campaign has gone through a number of recent transitions that fueled national speculation that his campaign is on the rocks. \\n \\n Within a span of about 1\\u00bd weeks ending June 9, all seven of Gingrich\\u2019s Iowa staff resigned, and so did several top national aides, some speaking publicly about what they described as a lackadaisical approach to fundraising and campaigning. \\n \\n And earlier this week the campaign announced that two key fundraising staff members had also resigned. \\n \\n The most paid for a straw poll spot came from Texas congressman Ron Paul.

Michele Bachmann. ||||| 5 years ago \\n \\n Washington (CNN) - Six Republican presidential campaigns secured spots Thursday to participate in the high stakes Ames Straw Poll in Iowa. \\n \\n Multiple GOP sources told CNN that the former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, businessman Herman Cain, former Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and, surprisingly, Michigan Rep. Thaddeus McCotter each paid a minimum of $15,000 to rent space outside the arena where the August 13 straw poll will take place. \\n \\n \\n \\n Newt Gingrich\\u2019s reportedly cash-strapped campaign, which had long-planned to run a robust Iowa effort, did not bid on a spot. Gingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis confirmed the decision, but said the candidate is \\u201ccommitted to the caucuses\\u201d and plans to return to the state several times in the coming weeks. \\n \\n McCotter, a guitar-playing conservative with a quirky reputation on Capitol Hill, has not made an official decision about running for president. But his investment in Ames is the most serious sign to date that he plans to join the ever-widening Republican field. \\n \\n Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman are each keeping their sights on New Hampshire rather than Iowa and have already announced plans to skip the straw poll. \\n \\n The contest, a fundraiser for the Iowa Republican Party that is traditionally seen as a test of each campaign\\u2019s organizational strength in the state, is hardly predictive. \\n \\n In 2007, Romney spent heavily to win the straw poll only to come up short in the caucuses to the Republican who finished second in the straw poll, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. \\n \\n Expectations are key: A strong showing can do wonders for lesser-known candidates, as it did for Huckabee in 2008. Conversely, an underwhelming performance can unravel a campaign hoping to do well in the caucuses. \\n \\n Iowa GOP officials ran a bidding process Thursday to auction off lots closest to arena, where each campaign will set up tents and stages to rally their supporters with food, music and swag before the vote. \\n \\n Positions closer to the Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State University, where the straw poll balloting occurs, are most expensive. \\n \\n Sources told CNN that Paul\\u2019s campaign outbid the competition and landed the premier location at the event site. Bachmann\\u2019s team is also said to have secured a first-rate spot. \\n \\n Bachmann spokesman Alice Stewart said her campaign is \\u201cpleased\\u201d with the space they landed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a pretty good spot,\\u201d she said. \\n \\n But in a sign that the Bachmann team views Pawlenty as one of their main rivals in the caucuses, Stewart immediately sought to raise expectations for the former governor in the straw poll. \\n \\n \\u201cPawlenty has made a big investment there for two years,\\u201d Stewart told CNN. \\u201cHe will be tough to be beat but we will be ready to spend a lot of time in Iowa.

Mallards are widely adaptable, from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory, and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to man-made, including reservoirs, urban parks and irrigation canals ( Carboneras 1992 ). Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck, Mallard diet has been well described. They are regarded as omnivorous, feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land ( Snow and Perrins 1998 ). Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates ( Dessborn et al. 2011 ), but may occasionally include amphibians or fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). The digestible protein content of the food, especially animal protein from insect larvae, appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings ( Street 1978 ). High-protein food is also required by Mallards during egg-laying, whereas other energy-demanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits ( Pehrsson 1984 ). Experimental work on nutrient-poor lakes in Sweden suggested that food limitation and adverse weather are major factors for high duckling mortality and why some lakes have low abundance or even absence of dabbling ducks ( Gunnarson et al. 2004 ). However, even during periods when the requirement for animal protein is at its highest, Mallards focus on aquatic invertebrates, and information on vertebrate predation is generally rarely reported. We report the first documented cases of hunting and consumption of birds by wild Mallards. Methods The Trei Ape reservoir (45\\u00b0 12\\u2032 N, 22\\u00b0 08\\u2032 E), bordering the Semenic-Caras Gorges National Park (Natura 2000 ROSCI0226 site) in southwest Romania, was visited over 6 days in July 2016. The reservoir, created in 1970, is a large, 53-ha freshwater body at 850-m altitude, with a maximum depth around 30 m and a relatively complex structure following river valleys in three main directions. It has moderate usage for tourism activities including camping, rowing and angling, primarily for European chub ( Squalius cephalus), European perch ( Perca fluviatilis ), brown trout ( Salmo trutta fario ) and Zander ( Sander lucioperca ). The edges of the reservoir are largely covered by woodland, mostly deciduous, with beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) and alder ( Alnus glutinosa ), scrub, and conifers, mainly Norway spruce ( Picea abies ). Sheep ( Ovis aries ) summer pastures cover the higher slopes of the northern shore. Most of the reservoir is deep, open water with little or no aquatic vegetation. However, dense and tall riparian vegetation areas exist where the three main streams feed into the lake, and large populations of amphibians, primarily common frog ( Ranatemporaria ) and common toad ( Bufo bufo ), breed in these sections ( Petrovan et al. 2006 ). Small numbers of Mallards (30\\u201350 pairs), Grey Herons ( Ardea cinerea ) and Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ) are typically encountered on the water's edge during March\\u2013October, together with more occasional observations of species such as Black Stork ( Ciconia nigra ). During May-September, large numbers of summer migrants, especially Black Redstarts ( Phoenicuros ochruros ), Barn Swallows ( Hirundo rustica ), House Martins ( Delichon urbicum ), and Red-backed Shrikes ( Lanius collurio), as well as other resident passerine birds such as Black-birds ( Turdus merula ), breed and raise their young on the edges of the reservoir. The Mallards are not fed by people and generally maintain a large flight distance. Results A group of Mallards ( n = 11) was observed on 17 July 2016 in the eastern part of the lake, in overcast weather with a temperature of 18 \\u00b0C, starting at 17:30 hr. The group consisted of one adult female with 10 subadults of consistent size, ~2/3 of the adult size and with incompletely formed plumage. Using binoculars and telephoto lenses, we observed the Mallards for ~15 min during their foraging activities at the water's edge. They were vigorously shaking the riparian and scrub vegetation on the bank. Following this activity, the adult Mallard was observed repeatedly shaking its head laterally and compressing a passerine bird in its bill. The bird was identified from pictures and recording video as a Grey Wagtail fledgling with almost complete plumage ( Fig. 1 ). The adult Mallard was repeatedly mobbed by the vocalizing subadults trying to remove parts of the bird carcass, but the adult defended it. The adult Mallard had obvious difficulties with swallowing the whole bird, partly due to the extended wings of the Grey Wagtail. The female Mallard repeatedly submerged the carcass, repositioned it in its bill and tilted its head backward, a process lasting over 10 min until the Grey Wagtail was eventually entirely consumed. During this time, a second bird was flushed from the bankside vegetation by the activity of the subadults shaking the long undergrowth, and landed on the water surface, some 30 m from the bank and 12 m away from the Mallard group. The bird, identified from pictures as a fledgling Black Redstart ( Fig. 2 ), opened its wings and started thrashing on the water's surface giving out distress calls. The Black Redstart was chased by several subadult Mallards and was repeatedly attacked, grabbed and submerged as the ducks tried to swallow it or remove parts of it. Following continuous attacks by between two to five Mallards positioned in a circle, the Black Redstart disappeared, either drowned and submerged or consumed by one or more of the subadults. During the attack, which lasted less than 3 min, the subadult Mallards continued to vocalize in short, repeated calls while trying to take control of the prey. The entire group of Mallards, including the adult female, then emerged onto a floating tree trunk for basking and preening as the group entered a phase of rest. Figure 1. Figure 2. Discussion Remarkably for such a widespread and well-studied species, these are, to our knowledge, the first observations of avian hunting and predation by Mallards. The completely new behavior exhibited by this group is even more significant considering that vertebrate consumption has rarely been described in this species and almost only on fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). Even Pekin (domestic) ducks ( A. platyrhynchos domesticus ) do not exhibit a tendency for aggressive and predatory behavior in commercial farming compared to other species such as Muscovy Ducks ( Cairina moschata ) ( Riber and Mensh 2008 ). Also, comparing wild and domesticated Mallards in an experimental setting demonstrated that wild Mallards show significant avoidance and reticence toward novel food ( Desforges and Wood-Gush 1975 ), possibly as an indication of either dietary conservatism or neophobia. This fits the wider literature observations of avian predators often avoiding novel insect prey ( Coppinger 1969 ) or reduced predation rates by birds of prey of songbird species with conspicuous plumage ( G\\u00f6tmark 1994 ). However, Mallards have recently been shown to learn to exploit new food sources, such as entering the sea to predate Pacific sand crabs ( Emerita analoga ) in multiple locations in California ( Lafferty et al. 2013 ). The fact that one predation event was conducted solely by the subadults, with great speed and with no hesitation, suggests they were experienced enough in such bird attacks to overcome any dietary conservatism. Yet, it seems unlikely that Mallards would have much success at capturing birds outside of the bird breeding season when fledglings are abundant, both on land and at the water's edge. Innovation during foraging can result in the development of new behaviors or the modification of existing ones to take advantage of new opportunities in the environment, such as the exploitation of new food sources ( Overington et al. 2011 ). If Mallards were limited by the lack of animal protein, for instance due to intense competition for insect larvae by fish introduced for angling ( Hill et al. 1987 ), it is possible that the inclusion of a new, energy-rich food source would offer a significant advantage at a critical time of the year. However, behavior innovation can increase risks, and predation of birds by Mallards could increase transmission of pathogens such as parasites or Salmonella, which has been found to be associated with raptors that predate other bird species ( Tizard 2004 ).

Poof, your bubble has been burst. The BBC reports wild mallard ducks have been spotted eating other birds, swallowing one nearly whole, an \\\"extraordinary\\\" behavior that has never been observed before. Zoologist Silviu Petrovan of the University of Cambridge was birdwatching at a reservoir in Romania when he spotted a flock of mallards hunting a fledgling that had landed on the water. A female duck grabbed the grey wagtail in her beak, dunked it several times beneath the water, then ate it, Petrovan says. A black redstart landed soon after and \\\"was almost instantaneously attacked\\\" by 10 juveniles, per the study in the journal Waterbirds. Though mallards in California have been sighted munching on sand crabs, the ducks usually eat plants, insects, and the occasional small fish. As far as scientists can tell, such predatory behavior not involving fish or amphibians has never been seen before. It's not only \\\"very rare\\\" but also likely a new phenomenon, says Petrovan, noting mallards have \\\"not ... really evolved\\\" to digest bones and feathers. \\\"The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail, presumably because it couldn't actually tear it to pieces\\\" due to the design of its bill. So why would a duck eat a bird at all?

fledgling black redstart \\n \\n Wild mallard ducks have been observed attacking and eating migratory birds \\n \\n This has never been documented before and is probably a new behaviour say scientists \\n \\n Zoologists at the University of Cambridge filmed a group of mallard ducks hunting other birds on a reservoir in Romania \\n \\n Two fledglings  a grey wagtail and a black redstart  were chased and swallowed when they landed in the water \\n \\n Mallards are one of the most abundant types of wild duck and a common sight in parks and on lakes \\n \\n The duck normally snacks on seeds acorns berries plants and insects \\n \\n It has on occasions been seen to eat small fish but bigger vertebrates are normally strictly off the menu \\n \\n Image copyright Silviu PetrovanMihai Leu Image caption The black redstart is captured \\n \\n Dr Silviu Petrovan noticed the unusual behaviour of a group of mallards while he was out bird watching with friends near a national park in southwest Romania \\n \\n He saw the adult female duck grab the grey wagtail in her beak and repeatedly submerge it in the water before eventually eating it \\n \\n A second bird  a fledgling black redstart  then landed in the water where it was chased by juvenile mallard ducks \\n \\n The poor bird landed on the water and was screaming and trying to navigate itself out of danger said Dr Petrovan Then it was almost instantaneously attacked by the mallards \\n \\n The bird eventually disappeared  assumed to be drowned or consumed \\n \\n The scientists could find no record of mallard bird predation in the scientific literature which suggests such behaviour is both very rare and newlylearned \\n \\n The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail presumably because it couldnt actually tear it to pieces because the bill is flattened  its not designed for ripping prey apart said Dr Petrovan \\n \\n Digesting bones and feathers  thats not something that mallards have really evolved to do \\n \\n Image copyright Silviu PetrovanMihai Leu Image caption The unfortunate grey wagtail is swallowed almost whole \\n \\n Ducks by nature are seldom aggressive and tend not to enjoy novel food \\n \\n However mallards in California have been seen to enter the sea to feed on sand crabs perhaps to find new sources of highenergy protein \\n \\n The same may be happening at the reservoir which is largely deepwater \\n \\n Potentially there is quite a lot of pressure for those fastgrowing juveniles to get animal protein intake and therefore they are looking at opportunities to supplement that said Dr Petrovan \\n \\n But the fact that these individuals seem to have learnt how to hunt birds is pretty extraordinary \\n \\n The findings are published in the journal Waterbirds \\n \\n Follow Helen on Twitter  The Mallard  Anas platyrhynchos  is one of the largest and most abundant and widespread duck species in the world and also the most hunted waterfowl species in Europe with around 45 million birds shot annually  Hirschfeld and Heyd 2005  Mallards are widely adaptable from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to manmade including reservoirs urban parks and irrigation canals  Carboneras 1992  Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck Mallard diet has been well described They are regarded as omnivorous feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land  Snow and Perrins 1998  Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates  Dessborn et al 2011  but may occasionally include amphibians or fish  Carboneras 1992  Olsen et al 2011  The digestible protein content of the food especially animal protein from insect larvae appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings  Street 1978  Highprotein food is also required by Mallards during egglaying whereas other energydemanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits  Pehrsson 1984  Experimental work on nutrientpoor lakes in Sweden suggested that food limitation and adverse weather are major factors for high duckling mortality and why some lakes have low abundance or even absence of dabbling ducks  Gunnarson et al 2004  However even during periods when the requirement for animal protein is at its highest Mallards focus on aquatic invertebrates and information on vertebrate predation is generally rarely reported We report the first documented cases of hunting and consumption of birds by wild Mallards Methods The Trei Ape reservoir 45\\u00b0 12\\u2032 N 22\\u00b0 08\\u2032 E bordering the SemenicCaras Gorges National Park Natura 2000 ROSCI0226 site in southwest Romania was visited over 6 days in July 2016 The reservoir created in 1970 is a large 53ha freshwater body at 850m altitude with a maximum depth around 30 m and a relatively complex structure following river valleys in three main directions It has moderate usage for tourism activities including camping rowing and angling primarily for European chub  Squalius cephalus European perch  Perca fluviatilis  brown trout  Salmo trutta fario  and Zander  Sander lucioperca  The edges of the reservoir are largely covered by woodland mostly deciduous with beech  Fagus sylvatica  and alder  Alnus glutinosa  scrub and conifers mainly Norway spruce  Picea abies  Sheep  Ovis aries  summer pastures cover the higher slopes of the northern shore Most of the reservoir is deep open water with little or no aquatic vegetation However dense and tall riparian vegetation areas exist where the three main streams feed into the lake and large populations of amphibians primarily common frog  Ranatemporaria  and common toad  Bufo bufo  breed in these sections  Petrovan et al 2006  Small numbers of Mallards 30\\u201350 pairs Grey Herons  Ardea cinerea  and Moorhen  Gallinula chloropus  are typically encountered on the waters edge during March\\u2013October together with more occasional observations of species such as Black Stork  Ciconia nigra  During MaySeptember large numbers of summer migrants especially Black Redstarts  Phoenicuros ochruros  Barn Swallows  Hirundo rustica  House Martins  Delichon urbicum  and Redbacked Shrikes  Lanius collurio as well as other resident passerine birds such as Blackbirds  Turdus merula  breed and raise their young on the edges of the reservoir The Mallards are not fed by people and generally maintain a large flight distance Results A group of Mallards  n  11 was observed on 17 July 2016 in the eastern part of the lake in overcast weather with a temperature of 18 \\u00b0C starting at 1730 hr The group consisted of one adult female with 10 subadults of consistent size 23 of the adult size and with incompletely formed plumage Using binoculars and telephoto lenses we observed the Mallards for 15 min during their foraging activities at the waters edge They were vigorously shaking the riparian and scrub vegetation on the bank Following this activity the adult Mallard was observed repeatedly shaking its head laterally and compressing a passerine bird in its bill The bird was identified from pictures and recording video as a Grey Wagtail fledgling with almost complete plumage  Fig 1  The adult Mallard was repeatedly mobbed by the vocalizing subadults trying to remove parts of the bird carcass but the adult defended it The adult Mallard had obvious difficulties with swallowing the whole bird partly due to the extended wings of the Grey Wagtail The female Mallard repeatedly submerged the carcass repositioned it in its bill and tilted its head backward a process lasting over 10 min until the Grey Wagtail was eventually entirely consumed During this time a second bird was flushed from the bankside vegetation by the activity of the subadults shaking the long undergrowth and landed on the water surface some 30 m from the bank and 12 m away from the Mallard group The bird identified from pictures as a fledgling Black Redstart  Fig 2  opened its wings and started thrashing on the waters surface giving out distress calls The Black Redstart was chased by several subadult Mallards and was repeatedly attacked grabbed and submerged as the ducks tried to swallow it or remove parts of it Following continuous attacks by between two to five Mallards positioned in a circle the Black Redstart disappeared either drowned and submerged or consumed by one or more of the subadults During the attack which lasted less than 3 min the subadult Mallards continued to vocalize in short repeated calls while trying to take control of the prey The entire group of Mallards including the adult female then emerged onto a floating tree trunk for basking and preening as the group entered a phase of rest Figure 1 Figure 2 Discussion Remarkably for such a widespread and wellstudied species these are to our knowledge the first observations of avian hunting and predation by Mallards The completely new behavior exhibited by this group is even more significant considering that vertebrate consumption has rarely been described in this species and almost only on fish  Carboneras 1992  Olsen et al 2011  Even Pekin domestic ducks  A platyrhynchos domesticus  do not exhibit a tendency for aggressive and predatory behavior in commercial farming compared to other species such as Muscovy Ducks  Cairina moschata   Riber and Mensh 2008  Also comparing wild and domesticated Mallards in an experimental setting demonstrated that wild Mallards show significant avoidance and reticence toward novel food  Desforges and WoodGush 1975  possibly as an indication of either dietary conservatism or neophobia This fits the wider literature observations of avian predators often avoiding novel insect prey  Coppinger 1969  or reduced predation rates by birds of prey of songbird species with conspicuous plumage  G\\u00f6tmark 1994  However Mallards have recently been shown to learn to exploit new food sources such as entering the sea to predate Pacific sand crabs  Emerita analoga  in multiple locations in California  Lafferty et al 2013  The fact that one predation event was conducted solely by the subadults with great speed and with no hesitation suggests they were experienced enough in such bird attacks to overcome any dietary conservatism Yet it seems unlikely that Mallards would have much success at capturing birds outside of the bird breeding season when fledglings are abundant both on land and at the waters edge Innovation during foraging can result in the development of new behaviors or the modification of existing ones to take advantage of new opportunities in the environment such as the exploitation of new food sources  Overington et al 2011  If Mallards were limited by the lack of animal protein for instance due to intense competition for insect larvae by fish introduced for angling  Hill et al 1987  it is possible that the inclusion of a new energyrich food source would offer a significant advantage at a critical time of the year However behavior innovation can increase risks and predation of birds by Mallards could increase transmission of pathogens such as parasites or Salmonella which has been found to be associated with raptors that predate other bird species  Tizard 2004  Literature Cited Carboneras C 1992 Family Anatidae ducks geese and swans Pages 536\\u2013628 in Handbook of the Birds of the World vol 1 Ostrich to Ducks  J del Hoyo A Elliott

The location of the candidates is considered critically important. \\n \\n Today\\u2019s bidding briefly took an emotional turn with several campaigns walked out in protest when a representative for U.S. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter, R-Mich., initially asked to bid without naming the congressman. \\n \\n Gingrich\\u2019s campaign sent an Iowa State student as its representative at the auction, Hammond said. The campaign may participate in the event but wasn\\u2019t interested in spending money for a premium spot, he said. \\n \\n After today, candidates can no longer purchase lots but may still participate in the straw poll, according to current rules. \\n \\n Gingrich\\u2019s campaign has gone through a number of recent transitions that fueled national speculation that his campaign is on the rocks. \\n \\n Within a span of about 1\\u00bd weeks ending June 9, all seven of Gingrich\\u2019s Iowa staff resigned, and so did several top national aides, some speaking publicly about what they described as a lackadaisical approach to fundraising and campaigning. \\n \\n And earlier this week the campaign announced that two key fundraising staff members had also resigned. \\n \\n The most paid for a straw poll spot came from Texas congressman Ron Paul. He spent $31,000 on a spot occupied by by the Mitt Romney campaign at the 2007 straw pol, said A.J.

Michele Bachmann. ||||| 5 years ago \\n \\n Washington (CNN) - Six Republican presidential campaigns secured spots Thursday to participate in the high stakes Ames Straw Poll in Iowa. \\n \\n Multiple GOP sources told CNN that the former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, businessman Herman Cain, former Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and, surprisingly, Michigan Rep. Thaddeus McCotter each paid a minimum of $15,000 to rent space outside the arena where the August 13 straw poll will take place. \\n \\n \\n \\n Newt Gingrich\\u2019s reportedly cash-strapped campaign, which had long-planned to run a robust Iowa effort, did not bid on a spot. Gingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis confirmed the decision, but said the candidate is \\u201ccommitted to the caucuses\\u201d and plans to return to the state several times in the coming weeks. \\n \\n McCotter, a guitar-playing conservative with a quirky reputation on Capitol Hill, has not made an official decision about running for president. But his investment in Ames is the most serious sign to date that he plans to join the ever-widening Republican field. \\n \\n Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman are each keeping their sights on New Hampshire rather than Iowa and have already announced plans to skip the straw poll. \\n \\n The contest, a fundraiser for the Iowa Republican Party that is traditionally seen as a test of each campaign\\u2019s organizational strength in the state, is hardly predictive. \\n \\n In 2007, Romney spent heavily to win the straw poll only to come up short in the caucuses to the Republican who finished second in the straw poll, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. \\n \\n Expectations are key: A strong showing can do wonders for lesser-known candidates, as it did for Huckabee in 2008. Conversely, an underwhelming performance can unravel a campaign hoping to do well in the caucuses. \\n \\n Iowa GOP officials ran a bidding process Thursday to auction off lots closest to arena, where each campaign will set up tents and stages to rally their supporters with food, music and swag before the vote. \\n \\n Positions closer to the Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State University, where the straw poll balloting occurs, are most expensive. \\n \\n Sources told CNN that Paul\\u2019s campaign outbid the competition and landed the premier location at the event site. Bachmann\\u2019s team is also said to have secured a first-rate spot. \\n \\n Bachmann spokesman Alice Stewart said her campaign is \\u201cpleased\\u201d with the space they landed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a pretty good spot,\\u201d she said. \\n \\n But in a sign that the Bachmann team views Pawlenty as one of their main rivals in the caucuses, Stewart immediately sought to raise expectations for the former governor in the straw poll. \\n \\n \\u201cPawlenty has made a big investment there for two years,\\u201d Stewart told CNN. \\u201cHe will be tough to be beat but we will be ready to spend a lot of time in Iowa.

Mallards are widely adaptable, from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory, and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to man-made, including reservoirs, urban parks and irrigation canals ( Carboneras 1992 ). Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck, Mallard diet has been well described. They are regarded as omnivorous, feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land ( Snow and Perrins 1998 ). Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates ( Dessborn et al. 2011 ), but may occasionally include amphibians or fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). The digestible protein content of the food, especially animal protein from insect larvae, appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings ( Street 1978 ). High-protein food is also required by Mallards during egg-laying, whereas other energy-demanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits ( Pehrsson 1984 ). Experimental work on nutrient-poor lakes in Sweden suggested that food limitation and adverse weather are major factors for high duckling mortality and why some lakes have low abundance or even absence of dabbling ducks ( Gunnarson et al. 2004 ). However, even during periods when the requirement for animal protein is at its highest, Mallards focus on aquatic invertebrates, and information on vertebrate predation is generally rarely reported. We report the first documented cases of hunting and consumption of birds by wild Mallards. Methods The Trei Ape reservoir (45\\u00b0 12\\u2032 N, 22\\u00b0 08\\u2032 E), bordering the Semenic-Caras Gorges National Park (Natura 2000 ROSCI0226 site) in southwest Romania, was visited over 6 days in July 2016. The reservoir, created in 1970, is a large, 53-ha freshwater body at 850-m altitude, with a maximum depth around 30 m and a relatively complex structure following river valleys in three main directions. It has moderate usage for tourism activities including camping, rowing and angling, primarily for European chub ( Squalius cephalus), European perch ( Perca fluviatilis ), brown trout ( Salmo trutta fario ) and Zander ( Sander lucioperca ). The edges of the reservoir are largely covered by woodland, mostly deciduous, with beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) and alder ( Alnus glutinosa ), scrub, and conifers, mainly Norway spruce ( Picea abies ). Sheep ( Ovis aries ) summer pastures cover the higher slopes of the northern shore. Most of the reservoir is deep, open water with little or no aquatic vegetation. However, dense and tall riparian vegetation areas exist where the three main streams feed into the lake, and large populations of amphibians, primarily common frog ( Ranatemporaria ) and common toad ( Bufo bufo ), breed in these sections ( Petrovan et al. 2006 ). Small numbers of Mallards (30\\u201350 pairs), Grey Herons ( Ardea cinerea ) and Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ) are typically encountered on the water's edge during March\\u2013October, together with more occasional observations of species such as Black Stork ( Ciconia nigra ). During May-September, large numbers of summer migrants, especially Black Redstarts ( Phoenicuros ochruros ), Barn Swallows ( Hirundo rustica ), House Martins ( Delichon urbicum ), and Red-backed Shrikes ( Lanius collurio), as well as other resident passerine birds such as Black-birds ( Turdus merula ), breed and raise their young on the edges of the reservoir. The Mallards are not fed by people and generally maintain a large flight distance. Results A group of Mallards ( n = 11) was observed on 17 July 2016 in the eastern part of the lake, in overcast weather with a temperature of 18 \\u00b0C, starting at 17:30 hr. The group consisted of one adult female with 10 subadults of consistent size, ~2/3 of the adult size and with incompletely formed plumage. Using binoculars and telephoto lenses, we observed the Mallards for ~15 min during their foraging activities at the water's edge. They were vigorously shaking the riparian and scrub vegetation on the bank. Following this activity, the adult Mallard was observed repeatedly shaking its head laterally and compressing a passerine bird in its bill. The bird was identified from pictures and recording video as a Grey Wagtail fledgling with almost complete plumage ( Fig. 1 ). The adult Mallard was repeatedly mobbed by the vocalizing subadults trying to remove parts of the bird carcass, but the adult defended it. The adult Mallard had obvious difficulties with swallowing the whole bird, partly due to the extended wings of the Grey Wagtail. The female Mallard repeatedly submerged the carcass, repositioned it in its bill and tilted its head backward, a process lasting over 10 min until the Grey Wagtail was eventually entirely consumed. During this time, a second bird was flushed from the bankside vegetation by the activity of the subadults shaking the long undergrowth, and landed on the water surface, some 30 m from the bank and 12 m away from the Mallard group. The bird, identified from pictures as a fledgling Black Redstart ( Fig. 2 ), opened its wings and started thrashing on the water's surface giving out distress calls. The Black Redstart was chased by several subadult Mallards and was repeatedly attacked, grabbed and submerged as the ducks tried to swallow it or remove parts of it. Following continuous attacks by between two to five Mallards positioned in a circle, the Black Redstart disappeared, either drowned and submerged or consumed by one or more of the subadults. During the attack, which lasted less than 3 min, the subadult Mallards continued to vocalize in short, repeated calls while trying to take control of the prey. The entire group of Mallards, including the adult female, then emerged onto a floating tree trunk for basking and preening as the group entered a phase of rest. Figure 1. Figure 2. Discussion Remarkably for such a widespread and well-studied species, these are, to our knowledge, the first observations of avian hunting and predation by Mallards. The completely new behavior exhibited by this group is even more significant considering that vertebrate consumption has rarely been described in this species and almost only on fish ( Carboneras 1992 ; Olsen et al. 2011 ). Even Pekin (domestic) ducks ( A. platyrhynchos domesticus ) do not exhibit a tendency for aggressive and predatory behavior in commercial farming compared to other species such as Muscovy Ducks ( Cairina moschata ) ( Riber and Mensh 2008 ). Also, comparing wild and domesticated Mallards in an experimental setting demonstrated that wild Mallards show significant avoidance and reticence toward novel food ( Desforges and Wood-Gush 1975 ), possibly as an indication of either dietary conservatism or neophobia. This fits the wider literature observations of avian predators often avoiding novel insect prey ( Coppinger 1969 ) or reduced predation rates by birds of prey of songbird species with conspicuous plumage ( G\\u00f6tmark 1994 ). However, Mallards have recently been shown to learn to exploit new food sources, such as entering the sea to predate Pacific sand crabs ( Emerita analoga ) in multiple locations in California ( Lafferty et al. 2013 ). The fact that one predation event was conducted solely by the subadults, with great speed and with no hesitation, suggests they were experienced enough in such bird attacks to overcome any dietary conservatism. Yet, it seems unlikely that Mallards would have much success at capturing birds outside of the bird breeding season when fledglings are abundant, both on land and at the water's edge. Innovation during foraging can result in the development of new behaviors or the modification of existing ones to take advantage of new opportunities in the environment, such as the exploitation of new food sources ( Overington et al. 2011 ). If Mallards were limited by the lack of animal protein, for instance due to intense competition for insect larvae by fish introduced for angling ( Hill et al. 1987 ), it is possible that the inclusion of a new, energy-rich food source would offer a significant advantage at a critical time of the year. However, behavior innovation can increase risks, and predation of birds by Mallards could increase transmission of pathogens such as parasites or Salmonella, which has been found to be associated with raptors that predate other bird species ( Tizard 2004 ).

Poof, your bubble has been burst. The BBC reports wild mallard ducks have been spotted eating other birds, swallowing one nearly whole, an \\\"extraordinary\\\" behavior that has never been observed before. Zoologist Silviu Petrovan of the University of Cambridge was birdwatching at a reservoir in Romania when he spotted a flock of mallards hunting a fledgling that had landed on the water. A female duck grabbed the grey wagtail in her beak, dunked it several times beneath the water, then ate it, Petrovan says. A black redstart landed soon after and \\\"was almost instantaneously attacked\\\" by 10 juveniles, per the study in the journal Waterbirds. Though mallards in California have been sighted munching on sand crabs, the ducks usually eat plants, insects, and the occasional small fish. As far as scientists can tell, such predatory behavior not involving fish or amphibians has never been seen before. It's not only \\\"very rare\\\" but also likely a new phenomenon, says Petrovan, noting mallards have \\\"not ... really evolved\\\" to digest bones and feathers. \\\"The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail, presumably because it couldn't actually tear it to pieces\\\" due to the design of its bill. So why would a duck eat a bird at all?

fledgling black redstart \\n \\n Wild mallard ducks have been observed attacking and eating migratory birds \\n \\n This has never been documented before and is probably a new behaviour say scientists \\n \\n Zoologists at the University of Cambridge filmed a group of mallard ducks hunting other birds on a reservoir in Romania \\n \\n Two fledglings  a grey wagtail and a black redstart  were chased and swallowed when they landed in the water \\n \\n Mallards are one of the most abundant types of wild duck and a common sight in parks and on lakes \\n \\n The duck normally snacks on seeds acorns berries plants and insects \\n \\n It has on occasions been seen to eat small fish but bigger vertebrates are normally strictly off the menu \\n \\n Image copyright Silviu PetrovanMihai Leu Image caption The black redstart is captured \\n \\n Dr Silviu Petrovan noticed the unusual behaviour of a group of mallards while he was out bird watching with friends near a national park in southwest Romania \\n \\n He saw the adult female duck grab the grey wagtail in her beak and repeatedly submerge it in the water before eventually eating it \\n \\n A second bird  a fledgling black redstart  then landed in the water where it was chased by juvenile mallard ducks \\n \\n The poor bird landed on the water and was screaming and trying to navigate itself out of danger said Dr Petrovan Then it was almost instantaneously attacked by the mallards \\n \\n The bird eventually disappeared  assumed to be drowned or consumed \\n \\n The scientists could find no record of mallard bird predation in the scientific literature which suggests such behaviour is both very rare and newlylearned \\n \\n The mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail presumably because it couldnt actually tear it to pieces because the bill is flattened  its not designed for ripping prey apart said Dr Petrovan \\n \\n Digesting bones and feathers  thats not something that mallards have really evolved to do \\n \\n Image copyright Silviu PetrovanMihai Leu Image caption The unfortunate grey wagtail is swallowed almost whole \\n \\n Ducks by nature are seldom aggressive and tend not to enjoy novel food \\n \\n However mallards in California have been seen to enter the sea to feed on sand crabs perhaps to find new sources of highenergy protein \\n \\n The same may be happening at the reservoir which is largely deepwater \\n \\n Potentially there is quite a lot of pressure for those fastgrowing juveniles to get animal protein intake and therefore they are looking at opportunities to supplement that said Dr Petrovan \\n \\n But the fact that these individuals seem to have learnt how to hunt birds is pretty extraordinary \\n \\n The findings are published in the journal Waterbirds \\n \\n Follow Helen on Twitter  The Mallard  Anas platyrhynchos  is one of the largest and most abundant and widespread duck species in the world and also the most hunted waterfowl species in Europe with around 45 million birds shot annually  Hirschfeld and Heyd 2005  Mallards are widely adaptable from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to manmade including reservoirs urban parks and irrigation canals  Carboneras 1992  Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck Mallard diet has been well described They are regarded as omnivorous feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land  Snow and Perrins 1998  Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates  Dessborn et al 2011  but may occasionally include amphibians or fish  Carboneras 1992  Olsen et al 2011  The digestible protein content of the food especially animal protein from insect larvae appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings  Street 1978  Highprotein food is also required by Mallards during egglaying whereas other energydemanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits  Pehrsson 1984  Experimental work on nutrientpoor lakes in Sweden suggested that food limitation and adverse weather are major factors for high duckling mortality and why some lakes have low abundance or even absence of dabbling ducks  Gunnarson et al 2004  However even during periods when the requirement for animal protein is at its highest Mallards focus on aquatic invertebrates and information on vertebrate predation is generally rarely reported We report the first documented cases of hunting and consumption of birds by wild Mallards Methods The Trei Ape reservoir 45\\u00b0 12\\u2032 N 22\\u00b0 08\\u2032 E bordering the SemenicCaras Gorges National Park Natura 2000 ROSCI0226 site in southwest Romania was visited over 6 days in July 2016 The reservoir created in 1970 is a large 53ha freshwater body at 850m altitude with a maximum depth around 30 m and a relatively complex structure following river valleys in three main directions It has moderate usage for tourism activities including camping rowing and angling primarily for European chub  Squalius cephalus European perch  Perca fluviatilis  brown trout  Salmo trutta fario  and Zander  Sander lucioperca  The edges of the reservoir are largely covered by woodland mostly deciduous with beech  Fagus sylvatica  and alder  Alnus glutinosa  scrub and conifers mainly Norway spruce  Picea abies  Sheep  Ovis aries  summer pastures cover the higher slopes of the northern shore Most of the reservoir is deep open water with little or no aquatic vegetation However dense and tall riparian vegetation areas exist where the three main streams feed into the lake and large populations of amphibians primarily common frog  Ranatemporaria  and common toad  Bufo bufo  breed in these sections  Petrovan et al 2006  Small numbers of Mallards 30\\u201350 pairs Grey Herons  Ardea cinerea  and Moorhen  Gallinula chloropus  are typically encountered on the waters edge during March\\u2013October together with more occasional observations of species such as Black Stork  Ciconia nigra  During MaySeptember large numbers of summer migrants especially Black Redstarts  Phoenicuros ochruros  Barn Swallows  Hirundo rustica  House Martins  Delichon urbicum  and Redbacked Shrikes  Lanius collurio as well as other resident passerine birds such as Blackbirds  Turdus merula  breed and raise their young on the edges of the reservoir The Mallards are not fed by people and generally maintain a large flight distance Results A group of Mallards  n  11 was observed on 17 July 2016 in the eastern part of the lake in overcast weather with a temperature of 18 \\u00b0C starting at 1730 hr The group consisted of one adult female with 10 subadults of consistent size 23 of the adult size and with incompletely formed plumage Using binoculars and telephoto lenses we observed the Mallards for 15 min during their foraging activities at the waters edge They were vigorously shaking the riparian and scrub vegetation on the bank Following this activity the adult Mallard was observed repeatedly shaking its head laterally and compressing a passerine bird in its bill The bird was identified from pictures and recording video as a Grey Wagtail fledgling with almost complete plumage  Fig 1  The adult Mallard was repeatedly mobbed by the vocalizing subadults trying to remove parts of the bird carcass but the adult defended it The adult Mallard had obvious difficulties with swallowing the whole bird partly due to the extended wings of the Grey Wagtail The female Mallard repeatedly submerged the carcass repositioned it in its bill and tilted its head backward a process lasting over 10 min until the Grey Wagtail was eventually entirely consumed During this time a second bird was flushed from the bankside vegetation by the activity of the subadults shaking the long undergrowth and landed on the water surface some 30 m from the bank and 12 m away from the Mallard group The bird identified from pictures as a fledgling Black Redstart  Fig 2  opened its wings and started thrashing on the waters surface giving out distress calls The Black Redstart was chased by several subadult Mallards and was repeatedly attacked grabbed and submerged as the ducks tried to swallow it or remove parts of it Following continuous attacks by between two to five Mallards positioned in a circle the Black Redstart disappeared either drowned and submerged or consumed by one or more of the subadults During the attack which lasted less than 3 min the subadult Mallards continued to vocalize in short repeated calls while trying to take control of the prey The entire group of Mallards including the adult female then emerged onto a floating tree trunk for basking and preening as the group entered a phase of rest Figure 1 Figure 2 Discussion Remarkably for such a widespread and wellstudied species these are to our knowledge the first observations of avian hunting and predation by Mallards The completely new behavior exhibited by this group is even more significant considering that vertebrate consumption has rarely been described in this species and almost only on fish  Carboneras 1992  Olsen et al 2011  Even Pekin domestic ducks  A platyrhynchos domesticus  do not exhibit a tendency for aggressive and predatory behavior in commercial farming compared to other species such as Muscovy Ducks  Cairina moschata   Riber and Mensh 2008  Also comparing wild and domesticated Mallards in an experimental setting demonstrated that wild Mallards show significant avoidance and reticence toward novel food  Desforges and WoodGush 1975  possibly as an indication of either dietary conservatism or neophobia This fits the wider literature observations of avian predators often avoiding novel insect prey  Coppinger 1969  or reduced predation rates by birds of prey of songbird species with conspicuous plumage  G\\u00f6tmark 1994  However Mallards have recently been shown to learn to exploit new food sources such as entering the sea to predate Pacific sand crabs  Emerita analoga  in multiple locations in California  Lafferty et al 2013  The fact that one predation event was conducted solely by the subadults with great speed and with no hesitation suggests they were experienced enough in such bird attacks to overcome any dietary conservatism Yet it seems unlikely that Mallards would have much success at capturing birds outside of the bird breeding season when fledglings are abundant both on land and at the waters edge Innovation during foraging can result in the development of new behaviors or the modification of existing ones to take advantage of new opportunities in the environment such as the exploitation of new food sources  Overington et al 2011  If Mallards were limited by the lack of animal protein for instance due to intense competition for insect larvae by fish introduced for angling  Hill et al 1987  it is possible that the inclusion of a new energyrich food source would offer a significant advantage at a critical time of the year However behavior innovation can increase risks and predation of birds by Mallards could increase transmission of pathogens such as parasites or Salmonella which has been found to be associated with raptors that predate other bird
